## Project Description: Predicting SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Success

### Project Scenario and Overview

The commercial space age is here, marked by significant advancements and affordability in space travel. Companies such as Virgin Galactic, Rocket Lab, Blue Origin, and SpaceX are at the forefront of this revolution. SpaceX, in particular, has achieved remarkable milestones, including:

- Sending spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS).
- Developing Starlink, a satellite internet constellation providing global satellite Internet access.
- Conducting manned missions to space.

One of the key factors behind SpaceX's success is the relatively low cost of their rocket launches, primarily due to the reusability of the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage. While other providers charge upwards of 165 million dollars per launch, SpaceX advertises a cost of just 62 million dollars, thanks to their ability to recover and reuse the first stage of the rocket.

Understanding the significance of the Falcon 9 first stage, it is crucial to predict whether it will land successfully. This prediction can help in determining the overall cost of a launch and in planning future missions. To visualize the scale and importance of the Falcon 9, consider the following:
- The payload is enclosed in the fairings.
- Stage two, or the second stage, helps bring the payload to orbit, but most of the work is done by the first stage.
- The first stage is significantly larger and more expensive than the second stage, as depicted in various diagrams and infographics.

Despite the advancements, the first stage does not always land successfully. It may crash, or SpaceX might sacrifice it based on mission parameters such as payload, orbit, and customer requirements.

### Project Role and Objectives

In this capstone project, you will assume the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company, Space Y, founded by billionaire industrialist Allon Musk. Your primary objective is to determine the price of each launch and predict the likelihood of the first stage landing successfully.

### Project Goals

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Gather historical data on SpaceX Falcon 9 launches, including information on payloads, launch sites, orbits, and first stage landing outcomes.
   - Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Perform EDA to uncover patterns and insights related to Falcon 9 launches.
   - Visualize key metrics such as the number of launches, success rates, payload masses, and landing outcomes.

3. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Create interactive dashboards using tools like Plotly Dash to visualize and communicate findings to the Space Y team.
   - Include visualizations such as line charts for yearly and monthly sales statistics, bar charts for vehicle type sales, and pie charts for advertising expenditure.

4. **Machine Learning Model Development**:
   - Develop and train a machine learning model to predict the success of the first stage landing based on public information.
   - Use classification algorithms to determine the likelihood of the first stage being reused.

5. **Model Evaluation and Deployment**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Deploy the model to provide real-time predictions for future Space Y launches.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: For data analysis, preprocessing, and model development.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Plotly Dash**: For creating interactive dashboards.
- **Scikit-learn**: For developing and evaluating machine learning models.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For web scraping and data collection from public sources.

### Conclusion

By the end of this project, you will have developed a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage landings and the associated costs. Your work will enable Space Y to make data-driven decisions, optimize launch costs, and compete effectively in the commercial space industry. This project not only demonstrates your technical skills but also your ability to apply data science to real-world challenges in the rapidly evolving field of space exploration.
